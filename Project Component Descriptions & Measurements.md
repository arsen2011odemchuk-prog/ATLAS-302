# Project Component Descriptions & Measurements

## Robot Torso (3D-printed)
- Shape: Rectangular with rounded edges
- Dimensions:
- Height: 150 mm
- Width: 100 mm
- Depth: 60 mm
Notes: Space inside for Raspberry Pi, batteries, and servo wiring. Include screw holes for arm and leg mounts.

## Arm Mounts
- Shape: L-shaped bracket
- Dimensions:
- Vertical length: 60 mm
- Horizontal length: 40 mm
- Thickness: 5 mm
Notes: Designed for 12g metal gear servos; holes spaced 20 mm apart for servo screws.

## Legs / Supports
- Shape: Cylindrical or rectangular beams depending on style
- Dimensions:
- Length: 100 mm per segment (can be adjusted for stability)
- Width: 15–20 mm
- Thickness: 5–7 mm (for 3D print infill strength)
Notes: Each leg segment attaches via screws to torso or joints; consider adding fillets for stress points.

## FPV Goggles Holder / Camera Mount
- Shape: Rectangular cradle with adjustable strap slots
- Dimensions:
- Length: 80 mm
- Width: 60 mm
- Depth: 50 mm
Notes: Should securely hold 3” FPV goggles and allow tilting for camera view.

## Servo Horns & Pushrods
- Dimensions:
- Horns: 20x11 mm and 1.2x21 mm
- Pushrods: 1.3 mm diameter × 180 mm length
Notes: For arm and leg articulation; ensure alignment with servo motor output.

## Electronics & Batteries
- Raspberry Pi 4: 88 mm × 58 mm × 19 mm
- Li-ion Battery Pack (2S 7.4V 2000 mAh): 70 mm × 45 mm × 18 mm
- Buck Converter / L7805: Approx. 50 mm × 30 mm × 15 mm

## Wiring / Cable Paths
- Male-to-male/female jumper wires: 200 mm
- Servo extension cables: 200–300 mm
Notes: Plan cable channels inside torso to avoid tangling.

## 3D Printing Notes
- Layer Height: 0.2 mm
- Infill: 25–30% for structural parts; 15–20% for shells/covers
- Supports: Required for arm mounts and angled overhangs
